## Contributing
For contributing, there's a number of things you should know.

### Logging
All logs are stored in `/logs` and can be configured in [config.json](/config/config.json) in *#logging*.
The logs are split into different categories:  
- **access** logs list all requests made to the API
- **server** logs are for internal error stuff (everything else)

Access logs are logged using morgan automatically.  
For server logging, we use [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). The usage is as follows:

> Result:
> ```log
> 2019-06-02T18:15:04.349Z [SERVER] INFO: Hello World
>```

### Database

We use mongodb to store all the data. After setting up the database,  
make sure to include the connection details in the main [config](/config/config.json) file.
